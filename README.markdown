This app is made to help you tracking your score for [Agricola](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola) a very nive boardgame by Uwe Rosenberg

This app is all made with javascript.
To achieve it here the livrary/framework used :


* [html5boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) : html5 app skeleton to start with
* [1kbgrid](http://www.1kbgrid.com/) : lightweight css grid
* [backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) : a simple and very elegant MVC framework
* [handlebars](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js) : nice templating language
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) : no need to tell you something about it ...


The main purpose is to learn theses awsome libs while taking some fun to code in js.
Maybe this app will become a full featured site or not. Who's know ?
